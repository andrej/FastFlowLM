/// \file model_backend.hpp
/// \brief Named execution backends for a model family
/// \note A backend names *where the kernels come from*, not which silicon runs
///       them: `flm` is FastFlowLM's own kernel flow, `rai` reaches them
///       through ryzenai-corelib. Both are causal_lm subclasses, but they
///       differ in how they are built and in how they must be driven. A
///       ModelBackend owns one engine and states those differences, so the
///       frontends stay backend-agnostic.
/// \note A backend id is *not* a platform id. Which generation the machine is
///       is utils::npu_platform's job, and one binary may carry several kernel
///       flows at once. Which flow runs a model is a property of the model:
///       the weights differ -- NPU2/Q4NX for flm, a Q8_0 GGUF for rai -- so a
///       model is packaged, tagged and pulled once per flow, and the tag says
///       which (kRaiFamilySuffix). The catalog's supported_platforms key
///       answers the other question, about the silicon.
/// \note This seam deliberately sits *above* causal_lm. The engine libraries in
///       src/lib/<runtime> are prebuilt against causal_lm.hpp, so that header is
///       a frozen ABI: adding or reordering a virtual there would silently shift
///       vtable slots in code this build cannot recompile.
